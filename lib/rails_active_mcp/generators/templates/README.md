================================================================================
Rails Console MCP has been installed!
================================================================================

Configuration:
- Initializer created at: config/initializers/rails_active_mcp.rb
- ActionMCP engine mounted at: /mcp
    - MCP tools created in: app/mcp/tools/
    - MCP server configuration: mcp.ru
- Audit log will be created at: log/rails_active_mcp.log

Next Steps:

       1. Install ActionMCP migrations:
                              rails action_mcp:install:migrations
rails db:migrate

2. Review and customize the configuration in config/initializers/rails_active_mcp.rb

3. Start the MCP server:
   rails server -c mcp.ru -p 3000

4. For Warp Terminal integration, add this to your MCP configuration:
   {
   "mcpServers": {
   "rails-console": {
   "command": "curl",
   "args": ["-X", "POST", "-H", "Content-Type: application/json",
   "http://localhost:3000/mcp"]
                                                             }
   }
   }

5. Test the installation:
   rails console
> RailsActiveMcp.safe?("User.count")
> RailsActiveMcp.execute("User.count")

Available Tools:
- console_execute: Execute Ruby code with safety checks
- safe_query: Execute read-only database queries
- dry_run: Analyze code safety without execution
- model_info: Get model schema and associations

Security Notes:
- Production mode enables strict safety by default
- All executions are logged to the audit file
- Dangerous operations are blocked in safe mode
- Review the safety patterns in the configuration

ActionMCP Integration:
- Tools are automatically discovered from app/mcp/tools/
- Uses streamable-http transport for production reliability
- Session management with database persistence
